# Top 50 Spotify Songs - 2019 ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§

Dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Overview
Our goal is to analyze the records in the dataset and visualize the data using Python.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Converted all column names to lowercase for consistency.
- **Genre and Artist Analysis:** Calculated the number of songs for each genre and artist.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Addressed any null values present in the dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data effectively.
- **Machine Learning Application:** Implemented machine learning algorithms to build a model that predicts the **popularity** of songs.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared the actual and predicted popularity.
- **Results Visualization:** Visualized the results for better understanding.

## Methodology
There are numerous techniques available to build an effective machine learning model capable of predicting song popularity.
