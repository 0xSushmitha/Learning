## About the Task 📜
From the given stock dataset, we will:
1. Analyze stock performance over the years.
2. Create graphs related to different attributes with a storytelling approach.
3. Build a model to predict stock prices.
4. Evaluate the model's performance.

## Context 🔍
This dataset pertains to **NSE (National Stock Exchange)** listed **KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK PVT. LTD.** Here’s a brief overview from Wikipedia:

Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited is an Indian banking and financial services company headquartered in Mumbai. It provides banking products and financial services to corporate and retail customers in personal finance, investment banking, life insurance, and wealth management.

### Required Python Libraries
To get started, install the following libraries:

```python
pip install pmdarima
pip install missingno
pip install kaleido
```

**Note:** GitHub does not support dynamic images, so I've included images of graphs in markdown cells.
