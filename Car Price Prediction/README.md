# Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

I gathered data from Kaggle, sourced from cardekho.com.

## The dataset includes a variety of car types. Our goal is to explore this data using EDA techniques and visualizations in Python.

Since the dataset isnâ€™t very large, thereâ€™s no need to implement Neural Networks, but I'll practice with them for experience. 

This is a regression problem, so we can also utilize **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost Regressor**.

Happy coding!
